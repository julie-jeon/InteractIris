Data Exploration

The Iris Dataset contains 150 instances of iris flowers, evenly distributed - 50 setosa, 50 viginica, and 50 versicolor. As I created the visualizations, I saw that there could be a possible correlation between the lengths of the petal, width of the petal, and species. I saw that the setosa species tended to have small petals, while the versicolor species was in between, and instances of the viginica species were prone to having the largest petals out of the three species. The same applied with the sepal lengths and sepal lengths. However, the average sepal width of the setosa species was the greatest.

My Experience

My experience creating this dashboard consisted of learning how to import the data I was working with into the graphs and tables I created. The greatest roadblock I experienced was learning the foundations of Power BI, as I had never used it before this project. A significant amount of time was spent watching videos and researching best practices in implementing the features that met the requirements of the project. The second challenge that I came across was comprehending what the project requirements implied - in task 6, I had not realized that the slicer for the variable was to be able to adjust the minimum and maximum measurements for all of the variables. Aside from the challenges, it was an enjoyable experience to learn how to use data visualization tools to gather insight into the dataset that I was given to work with.
